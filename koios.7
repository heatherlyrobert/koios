.SH NAME
koios \- c language unit testing meta-language and parser

.SH PATRON (roughly pronounced key-oh-s)
.B koios-polos
(axis of heaven), titan of intelligence and farsight

.SH IMAGERY
northern star around which all the other consellations revolve

.SH SUMMARY
koios is a meta-language and related parser to simplify, standardize, and
make executable unit tests for the c language.  it is integrated with yUNIT,
yVAR, and ouroborus (on a system-wide basis).

.SH CAVEAT
nobody will ever use my programs ;) they use my shared libraries (zero public),
keyboard centric usage, one true language (c) focus, and experimental/crazy
designs.  dedicated dog-fooder, no time to coddle.

.SH SCOPE, REASONING and DECISION

.B subject/definition (D).  
unit testing is a software verification and assurance method in which a
programmer tests if individual units (functions) of source code are fit for
use and remain so.

.B importance/priority (I).  
unit testing is the most fundamental and important layer upon which all
other testing rests.  it drives reliable build automation, refactoring,
and regression testing.

.B situation (S).  
unit testing is a universal, fundamental, and critical need which is widely
recognized.  there are many competing freeware and commercial unit testing
frameworks available across all platforms.

.B complication (C).  
these frameworks are often awkward, changing, partial, and inflexible as unit
testing is both universally accepted and universally negnected.  they are
marketed and unevenly utilized.

.B problem/question (Q).  
i need to have a rapidly adapting and evolving tool that both drives and
supports my learning in this crutial area.  i don't want to just understand,
i want to own this area.

.B solution/answer (A).  
build several intelocking tools to provide a complete unit testing solution
-- koios to generate c unit tests, yUNIT to guide them, and yVAR to compare
expected and actuals.

.B target user (T).  
very technical, well-versed, power user.

.B accepted functionality (a).  
   -- use the universal condition and step analogy
   -- group conditions into sections, scripts, and groups
   -- allow multiple testing files for complicated programs
   -- allow individual scripts to be uniquely run
   -- provide detailed pass/fail feedback on all steps
   -- collect and report statistics for conditions and scripts

.B new functionality (n).  
   -- built in, standard format grey-box accessors
   -- allow very selective verbosity levels in output

.B rejected functionality (r).  
   -- no commercial software
   -- no major libraries
   -- avoid pointer references and cleverness

.B as always, all my applications must (#).  
   -- run on any linux box from raspberry to cray
   -- stay focused, small, tight, reliable, and secure
   -- forgo sloppy, kitchen-sink languages, like python, java, or perl
   -- stay away from dependency on external code libraries, like boost
   -- only human-readable, 7-bit safe, ascii streams (not database)
   -- have dedicated, maintained, automated unit testing
   -- all tables must be self describing with labels and queries
   -- all data structures must include dumps, reports, and audits
   -- provide extensive logging and tracing for debugging
   -- use secure communications between systems where required
   -- clean, clean code so i can maintain after long absences
   -- no international, multi-lang, multi-byte support (freaking ever)
   -- one-hundred percent keyboard driven and centric
   -- operate using modes and windows/panels like vi/vim
   -- follow the yVIKEYS standard to the letter

.SH BATCH INPUT and OUTPUT
koios is a batch program with no interactive component.  as such, is is
critical to understand the input and output expectatons.

.B [BASENAME].unit
, a 7bit safe, human-readable ascii text file that contains the unit testing
meta-language describing the unit test.  its structure and contests are
described in the koios(5) man section.

.B [BASENAME]_unit.c
, a 7bit safe, human-readable ascii text file contained the resulting
c source code to be linked to your program, compiled, and executed as
described in the koios(1) man section.

.B [BASENAME].unit.new
, a 7bit safe, human-readable ascii text file that contains the unit testing
meta-language describing the unit test.  the contents have simply be updated
to the latest formatting standard.

.SH HERITAGE
.B background.  
koios-polos (north star) is one of the original twelve greek titans,
extremely wise, intelligent, resolved, and capable of predicting the future
(prophecy). when the titans overthrew the protogenos (primeval gods), koios was
the god that held ouranos (sky) by the northern pole of the world.  koios is
the god of the axis of heaven around which the constellations revolved and
of the heavenly oracles.

.B appearance.  
koios is twenty feet tall, has eyes and hair of blue-white, and wears a bears
head helm and black armor with a diamond in the breast plate.

.B parentage/lineage.  
he is the second son of ouranos (father-sky) and gaia (mother-earth).  he is
the grandfather of apollo, artemis, and hekate.

.B why use this imagery.  
unit testing is named after koios as the titan of the questioning mind and
prophecy since it will seek to determine an applications fitness to run
in production.

.SH BUGS and CONCERNS
koios depends on proper formatting of the input meta-language file.  if the
file lacks a double quote or delimiter in the correct place, the resulting
errors when compiling the c source for the unit test can be difficult to
track down.
