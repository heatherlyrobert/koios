.SH NAME
koios_polos \- sweet c unit testing metaprogram and mini-language

.SH IMAGERY (see HERITAGE at bottom for more)
northern star (polos), the axis around which all consellations revolve

.SH SUMMARY
koios (pronounced key-oh-s) is a light, clean, simple, and fast c unit testing
metaprogram that reads a scripting mini-language file as input and creates a c
source file to conduct the unit testing as output.

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B koios [BASENAME]
.nf
which is the primary production version

.B koios_debug [URGENTS] [BASENAME]
.nf
which can perform all production actions, but with debugging and tracing

.SH OPTIONS
there are two levels of options in the heatherly unit testing framework.
the first is for koios which converts the unit testing meta-language input file
into a c source file.  second is for the compilied unit test itself.

.SH KOIOS RUNTIME OPTIONS
koios is simple, efficient, and direct; and, it only has a very limited
run-time configuration with only three options.

.B <basename>
.RS 8
base unit test file name with no ".unit" extention (required).
.RE

.B --create
.RS 8
creates unit testing c source file for compilation (default).
.RE

.B --update
.RS 8
update unit test input to latest standard and send to stdout.
.RE

the --create and --update options are mutually exclusive.

.SH UNIT TESTING RUNTIME OPTIONS
koios is simple, efficient, and direct; and, it only has a very limited
run-time configuration with only three options.




.B unittest.  
unit tests provide two main types of options -- verbosity and execution.



.SH COMPILING
to work properly, the main function of the c program must be placed in
a separate source file.  i call mine by the [BASENAME]_main.c.  the unit
test creates its own main function within [BASENAME]_unit.c.  all program
modules (except main) need to be linked against [BASENAME]_unit.c to create
an executable.  i name the resulting executable [BASENAME]_unit.

.SH EXECUTING
the resulting [BASENAME]_unit executable has several options build in.

.B @@quiet
, no output only a return code : neg = fail, pos = warn, 0 = pass

.B @@test
, only a single line of summary numbers indicating pass/fail

.B --list-scrp
, shows a list of script headers for reference (no execution).

.B --list-cond
, shows a list of condition headers for all scripts (no execution).

.B <nn> --list-cond
, with script number it will only show for that script.

.B --scrp
, shows summary and script level output.  no step details

.B @@cond
, shows summary, script, and condition output. no step details.

.B @@step
, shows summary, script, and condition, and step output. no details.

.B @@full
, shows all output.  this is the default.

.B --console
, show plain text without terminal color codes.

.B --eterm
, show output with embedded eterm, 256 color terminal color codes.

.B <nn>
, two digits with a leading zero if required to make two.  this
causes the unit test to only run the script by that number.

.B <nnn>
, three digits with a leading zeros if required to make three.  this causes
the unit test to only show the condition by that number.  sometimes this
makes it easier to find in the output.

.SH HERITAGE
koios-polos (northern axis) is one of the original twelve greek titan-gods and
the archetype of the inquisitive and questioning mind.  when the titans
overthrew the protogenos (primeval gods), koios was the god that held ouranos
(sky) by the northern pole of the world.  koios is the god of the axis of heaven
around which the constellations revolved and of the heavenly oracles.  he was
also husband to phoebe who presided over the earth oracles.
